# Features & Usage

## Search

The **Search** page is the primary way to find content.
- Use the search bar to find words, authors, or poems.
- Results are displayed in a list. Click an item to view its details.

## Item View

When you select an item, you are taken to the **Item Page**. This view displays:
- **Definition**: The core text of the entry.
- **Rich Content**: Links to other items, embedded poems, and quotes.
- **Media**: Images (if available) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) controls.
- **Derivation**: Etymology or origin information.
- **Appendices**: Additional notes.

## Graph View (Experimental)

The **Graph** view visualizes the connections between items.
- Nodes represent items (words, authors).
- Edges represent relationships (links).
- You can interact with the graph to explore the network of literary terms.

## Reports

The **Reports** section provides specialized lists and analytics, such as:
- Items with missing definitions.
- Orphaned items (no links).
- Statistics on database growth.

## Tables

The **Tables** view allows for raw data inspection. You can browse the underlying database tables (`Items`, `Links`, `Cliches`, etc.) directly.

## Command Palette

Press `Cmd+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to open the **Command Palette**. This tool allows you to:
- Quickly jump to a specific page.
- Search for items without leaving your current view.
- Execute commands like "Go to Settings" or "Toggle Theme".

## Settings
