# Getting Started

## Installation

The Poetry Application is distributed as a desktop application for macOS and Windows.

1.  Download the latest release for your operating system.
2.  **macOS**: Drag the `Poetry Maker.app` to your Applications folder.
3.  **Windows**: Run the installer or executable.

## First Run

Upon launching the application for the first time, you may be presented with a "First Run" modal or setup wizard. This process initializes the local database and ensures all necessary assets are in place.

## The Dashboard

The **Dashboard** is your home screen. It provides an at-a-glance view of the database statistics:

*   **Total Items**: Number of words and definitions.
*   **Total Links**: Number of connections between items.
*   **Counts**: Quotes, Cited Works, Writers, Poets, Titles, etc.

From the Dashboard, you can quickly navigate to other sections using the sidebar menu or the Command Palette.
